        abstract: "The FAIR Principles (https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) have propelled the global debate in all disciplines on the importance of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data, by humans and machines, and the need for better research data management, transparent and reproducible data worldwide. FAIR has united stakeholders world-wide behind a common concept: good data management under common standards. It is no longer optional. However, the FAIR Principles are aspirational, and putting FAIR into practice is work in progress; it 'takes a village'! Starting with a brief history of the Principles, Susanna will paint the landscape of key initiatives and community activities for FAIR data, with a focus in the Life Science, including resources like FAIRsharing (https://fairsharing.org), and the FAIR Cookbook (https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org)."
