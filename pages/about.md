## About GigaDB
![GigaDB logo](../assets/img/gigadb-transparent-06.png)
<i>(GigaDB)[http://gigadb.org]</i> is a data repository supporting scientific publications in the Life/Biomedical Sciences domain. GigaDB works with authors to organize and curate data from individually publishable units into datasets, which are provided openly and in as FAIR manner as possible for the global research community. Through our association with (DataCite)[http://www.datacite.org/], each dataset in GigaDB will be assigned a (DOI)[http://www.doi.org/] that can be used as a standard citation for future use of these data in other articles by the authors and other researchers. To maximize its utility to the research community, the datasets in GigaDB are placed under a (CC0 waiver)[http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/].
