GigaScience - licenses

Images (including figures)
<p>If an image is used in the narrative then it is given CC-BY. If we only host it in GigaDB then it can be CC0 (with the authors consent). This means most of the images we have used as thumbnail images should be set as cc-by.</p>
<p>One important aspect that few authors know: The attempt to protect raw data with a copyright licence is futile because copyright only protects &quot;creative works&quot;. Tabular data, DNA sequences, also photographs of documentary character  (e.g. from an automated imaging platform) are not creative works. They are not protected by copyright and can be freely re-used, no matter what licence you attach to the manuscript or the repo.</p>
<p>- if the same table is present in the narrative and it is a &quot;creative work&quot; (i.e. not produced by a machine/tool) then we need to label it as CC-BY in GigaDB if we host a copy of it, but we should think twice about whether a copy is needed and why. For full data tables of stuff that is only summarised in the narrative, or tables that are not &quot;creative works&quot; then we can host that as CC0. For tabular data underlying figures in the narrative we can host that as CC0.</p>
<p>HTML files - (need to discuss this) are they code or data or narrative? according to the Choose a license website (linked above) its code and should have an OSI license, but they also use this example of a license file on their own repository:</p>
<p>License</p>
<p>The content of this project itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license, and the underlying source code used to format and display that content is licensed under the MIT license.</p>
<p>i.e. the html code is OSI license, but the presented information is CC-BY.</p>
<h3>Dealing with mixed archive licenses</h3>
<p>Bundles of code &amp; data</p>
<p>- We need to encourage authors to provide a license.txt file within the bundle to clearly define which files have which licenses. Where we host a bundle as a single file we may need to think of a way to define a mixed license?</p>
<p>Tazro Ohta recent paper &quot;A workflow reproducibility scale for automatic validation of biological interpretation results&quot; includes an example of how to do this in his </span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://zenodo.org/record/7572174" target="_blank">Zenodo dataset</a> (see the file called license.txt).</p>
<h3>DataCite metadata for licenses</h3>
<p>The GigaDB datasets automatically include the CC0 license in the dataset level metadata. We need to explore ways in which we can ensure the other license used in a particular dataset are also represented in the DataCite metadata. Currently all our dataset have this in the DataCite metadata:</p>
~~~
<rightsList>

        <rights rightsURI="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 1.0 Universal</rights>

<rightsList<
~~~
<br>
The PID forum have suggested that the best way is to duplicate the RightsList field with all appropriate licenses used:
<br>
~~~
<rightsList>

        <rights rightsURI="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 1.0 Universal</rights>

        <rights rightsURI="https://opensource.org/license/mit/">MIT</rights>

		etc...

</rightsList>
~~~
<br>
However, I'm wondering if maybe we can just change the boiler plate metadata to include this:
<br>
~~~
<rightsList>

        <rights rightsURI="info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess">Open Access</rights>

        <rights rightsURI="https://>URL to the license.txt file in the dataset<"bespoke license file"</rights>
</rightsList>
~~~
<br>

<p>It requires more discussion and a tech solution to the datacite metadata creation.</p>
<p><b>External databases</b> - We have no control over licenses used in other databases, however we can stipulate which licenses are acceptable for use in publications by GigaScience Press. When an author chooses to submit their data to Zenodo/Dryad/Figshare etc instead of using GigaDB then we can tell them that they have to set the licenses appropriately, i.e. as described above, CC0 for data, OSI for code etc. 
</p>
<p>Where the data is being re-used in a paper and was published by someone other than our authors then we can only stipulate that the manuscript is only acceptable if those data are &quot;Open Access&quot;, by this we mean; minimum of CC-BY for data and images, OSI for code. In addition, they should be hosted in a stable repository that does not require payment. Ideally, anonymous use is best, but often databases require login but registration is free and open to all.</p>
<p><b>We have some notable exceptions to the rules on sources of reused data</b>; e.g. </p>
* CodeOcean only allows registered users to create capsules, to be able to register you must have a university institute email address. but after the capsule is published it can be accessed by anyone.<br>
* drugBank which is free to use for academics, but not open access in the usual sense. <br>
* GISAID repo for SarsCov2 sequences comes to mind, where users have to sign a TOS agreement <br>

<p><b>Restricted access databases-</b> When data is of a sensitive nature e.g. human identifiable, we expect authors to use a restricted access repository e.g. ENA, UKBioBank,dbGap etc... where the data is hosted as openly as possible and access can be granted to people by application.</p>
<p><b>Zenodo -</b> There are user interface issues with Zenodo, in that it only shows CCBY options by default when selecting the "open" option, but if the user types in the phrase "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal" then they can select that as an option, see screenshot below.</p>
